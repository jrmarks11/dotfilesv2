# Dot files

I use nvim tmux and zsh.

My nvim configuration relies heavily on fzf.

There are comments some places but this isn't very well documented.

## setup(with HomeBrew)

- git clone this repo into your home directory.
- cd into it and run

```sh
./macos/brew.sh
stow config
stow tmux
stow zsh ...
```

Someday when if not lazy maybe ill make one script that does the whole
install.
