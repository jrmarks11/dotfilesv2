# Dot files

I use vim tmux and zsh.

My vim configuration relies heavily on fzf.

There are comments some places but this isn't very well documented.


### setup(with HomeBrew):
* Install zplugin(https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin)
* git clone this repo into your home directory.
* cd into it and run
```
./macos/brew.sh
stow vim
stow tmux
stow zsh ...
```
Someday when if not lazy maybe ill make one script that does the whole
install.
