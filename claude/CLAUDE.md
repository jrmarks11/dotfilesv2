# CLAUDE.md

Personal coding preferences and style guidelines for Claude Code.

## Code Style Preferences

- **Duplication**: Always look out for excessive duplication and refactor when found
- **Comments**: Only add comments when explicitly requested
- **Existing Comments**:
  Preserve all existing comments unless explicitly asked to modify them
- **Implementation Focus**:
  Prioritize current functionality over backwards compatibility unless explicitly
  requested
- **Code Quality**:
  Focus on implementation and functionality - run tests, lint, format, or type-checks
  only when specifically requested
